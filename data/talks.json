Enzymes that manipulate the geometry and topology of cellular DNA perform many vital cellular processes (including segregation of daughter chromosomes, gene regulation, DNA repair, and generation of antibody diversity). Some enzymes pass DNA through itself via enzyme-bridged transient breaks in the DNA; other enzymes break the DNA apart and reconnect it to different ends. In the topological approach to enzymology, circular DNA is incubated with an enzyme, producing an enzyme signature in the form of DNA knots and links. By observing the changes in DNA geometry (supercoiling) and topology (knotting and linking) due to enzyme action, the enzyme binding and mechanism can often be characterized. This talk will discuss topological models for DNA strand passage and exchange, including the analysis of site-specific recombination experiments on circular DNA and the analysis of packing geometry of DNA in viral capsids. </p>",

      "abstract": "<p align=\"justify\">Quantum computation can be regarded as a methodical study of the structure preparation, evolution, and measurement of quantum systems in a computational framework. In a quantum system, a physical state corresponds to a unit length vector in a complex space (Hilbert space or finite dimensional complex space depending on the problem). A physical process corresponds to the application of a unitary transformation to a state. A measurement of a state projects that state to one of a number of orthogonal possibilities represented by an orthonormal basis for the complex space. The probability of a measurement is the absolute square of its coefficient in the state vector. A quantum computer consists in a unitary transformation and the capability to prepare states, apply the unitary transformation and measure the results. The statistics of repeated measurement gives the information for the computation. Thus the key to quantum computing is the design of unitary transformations that can accomplish a particular task. There are a number of designs that are very interesting such as Shor’s method of factoring integers on a quantum computer. The design of actual quantum computers is very difficult because it is hard to control measurement and keep the system from decohering in its interaction with the environment. It is thought that topological physical situations, such as the behaviour of anyons in the quantum Hall effect or the behaviour of Majorana Fermions in nano wires, may hold the key to the desired fault tolerant computation. In both of these instances one can formulate the unitary transformations in terms of representations of the Artin Braid group that are related to the physics of the situation. It is thought that such topological phases of physical systems will be resistant to perturbation and will make scalable quantum computing possible. It is the purpose of this talk to describe braiding related to both the quantum Hall effect (the Fibonacci model) and unitary braiding related to Majorana Fermions (braiding from Clifford algebras). The talk will be self-contained and as pictorial as possible. </p>",

Although this number is small relative to the total number of protein structures solved, it is remarkably high given the fact that for decades it was thought impossible for a protein chain to fold and thread in such a way as to create a knotted structure. There are four different types of knotted protein structures that contain 31, 41, 52 and 61 knots and over the past 15 years there has been an increasing number of experimental and computational studies on these systems. The folding pathways of knotted proteins have been studied in some detail, however, the focus of this talk is to address the fundamental question “Why are there knots in proteins?” It is known that once formed, knotted protein structures tend to be conserved by nature. This, in addition to the fact that, at least for some deeply knotted proteins, their folding rates are slow compared with many unknotted proteins, has led to the hypothesis that there are some properties of knotted proteins that are different from unknotted ones, and that this had resulted in some evolutionary advantage over faster folding unknotted structures. In this talk, I will review the evidence for and against this theory. In particular, how a knot within a protein chain may affect the thermodynamic, kinetic, mechanical and cellular (resistance to degradation) stability of the protein will be discussed. </p>",

A message consists of data that have to be sent to a destination node, i.e. the message itself plus a finite amount of space that keeps only a constant amount of data to aid a message to reach its destination, e.g. the address of the starting and destination nodes, a constant number of nodes visited, etc. Local means that at each site we have at our disposal only local information regarding a node and its neighbors, i.e. no global knowledge of the network is available at any time, other that the network is planar and connected. We then develop location aided local routing algorithms for wireless communication networks, in particularly cellular telephone networks. </p>",

Twenty years of their investigation suggests that they fold via a slipknot conformation, across the native twisted loop. During the talk I will show that diversity of identified folds of knotted proteins and their locations in cells is still growing and surprising us. <br> Moreover recently we went one step further and found that proteins can be even more entangled than knots – they also form lassos and links, which consist of several components. Based on the search through the entire Protein Data Bank we identified several sequentially nonhomologous chains that form a Hopf link, a Solomon link [2], and various types of lassos. I will show that topological properties of these proteins are related to their function and stability. Finally I will explain how the presence of links affects folding pathways of proteins and present new reaction coordinate to study entangled proteins. <br> During my talk I will also present knotted TrmD which is the leading antimicrobial drug target owing to its essen­tiality for bacterial growth, its broad conservation across bacterial species, and its substantial differences from the human and archaeal counterpart Trm5.

I will discuss a recent variation (with Huanyu Wen) where we add a drift that promotes entanglement. Finally, I will present ongoing work (with Gage Bonner and Benedek Valko) on the much more challenging problem of winding around several obstacles.

Returning the chromosomes to an unlinked monomeric state is essential to cell survival. Simplification of DNA topology is mediated by enzymes, such as recombinases and topoisomerases. We here focus on site-specific recombinases that recognize two short segments of DNA (the recombination sites), introduce two double stranded breaks and recombine the ends. The local action of site-specific recombinases is a reconnection event which is modeled mathematically as a band surgery. The banding is coherent or non-coherent, depending on the relative orientation of the recombination sites. We use tools from low dimensional topology to investigate the mechanism of action of these enzymes, and we complement the analytical work with computer simulations. The numerical work provides a quantitative measure to distinguish among pathways of topology simplification by recombination, and also informs the search for bandings between specific pairs of link types. </p>",

In this talk, we develop a theory of Gaussian random graph embeddings in order to model the shapes of these polymers in solution. The theory allows us to connect the expected radius of gyration of the polymers with the Kirchhoff index of the graph. We will prove a theorem that describes the asymptotic behavior of the expected radius of gyration for large graphs of fixed topology in terms of the degree-Kirchhoff index of the graph. Last, we show that our theory provides a good fit to data from the Tezuka lab's experimental measurements of the relative sizes of topological polymers with different graph types. </p> <p> This talk is joint work with Tetsuo Deguchi and Erica Uehara (Ochanomizu University) and Clayton Shokwiler (Colorado State University), with support from the Simons Foundation (#354225 and #52412) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (CREST Grant Number JPMJCR19T4, Deguchi Lab) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP17H06463. </p>",

After introducing these notions and outlining their relevance to random complexes and to topological overlap theorems, we will discuss two results. The first concerns an application of cosystolic expansion to a stability version of the cohomological classification of <em>G</em>-covering spaces (joint work with Irit Dinur).

It plays a central role in the development of algorithms for meshing Euclidean domains. In applications where an anisotropic mesh is desired, a standard approach is to consider a Riemannian metric defined over the domain and to construct an approximate Delaunay triangulation with respect to this metric.</p> <p>In the case of surfaces, it has been shown that a Delaunay triangulation exists if the set of sample points is sufficiently dense but this is no longer true in higher dimensional manifolds: sample density alone is not sufficient to ensure that the Delaunay complex is a triangulation. To walk around this difficulty, we first introduce perturbation algorithms in Euclidean space that make the Delaunay triangulation of well-distributed point sets quantifiably stable with respect to perturbations of the metric or of the point positions. We then adapt this Euclidean perturbation algorithm to the context of compact manifolds equipped with a metric that can be locally approximated by a Euclidean metric. In particular, this includes Riemannian metrics, as well as the extrinsic metric on submanifolds variations of which have been exploited in algorithms for reconstructing submanifolds of Euclidean space from a finite set of sample points. The simplicial complex produced by our algorithm is naturally equipped with a piecewise flat metric that is a quantifiably good approximation to the metric on the original manifold. </p>",

Classical elastic rod models have been applied to DNA supercoiling, knotting, and cyclization, while base-pair level models of DNA made it possible to incorporate the effects of nucleotide sequence and the negative charge of DNA in new mesoscale models of complex DNA-protein assemblies, which yielded insights into the role of DNA deformability in gene regulation. More recently, simulations of the dynamics of elastic rods submerged in a viscous incompressible fluid has been conducted in order to gain understanding of the behavior of topologically constrained DNA molecules.

For this the Hamiltonian needs to support conserved charges, and the occurrence of a time crystal becomes relates to the wider concept of spontaneously broken symmetries. Except that in the case of a time crystal, the symmetry breaking takes place in a dynamical context.

      "abstract": "<p align=\"justify\">George Dantzig’s Simplex method is a work horse of modern computational mathematics. Because linear programs (LPs) appear in all areas of application the Simplex methods was elected as one of the top 10 algorithms in the 20th century. Surprisingly, despite its popularity and almost 80 years of research we still do not fully understand its complexity and behavior. </p>  <p align=\"justify\">To bound the number of iterations of the Simplex method we take a geometric point of view and investigate the possible lengths of monotone paths inside the oriented graphs of polyhedra (oriented by the objective function). We are interested in both the shortest and the longest monotone paths possible and estimate the (monotone) diameter and the height of some famous combinatorial polyhedra (such as TSP, fractional matching polytopes, and others). But how far apart are two monotone paths of an LP? E.g., if I use two pivot rules the Simplex method traces two paths, is there a notion of distance between them?. As we look at all monotone paths together we see a metric space structure which can be used to count how many are there or to generate them randomly. This comes from a very natural graph (the flip-path graph) and CW complex structures (cellular-strings complex) on the set of monotone paths These objects are important in topological combinatorics (Baues complexes and polyhedral subdivisions studied by Billera, Sturmfels, Gelfand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky and others in the early 1990’s) and in discrete optimization (In particular the complexity of the simplex method with work going back to Klee). In my talk I will discuss some natural counting problems associated with the discrete geometric situation. Our main enumerative results include bounds on the number of monotone paths, and on the the diameter of the space of monotone paths (how far are two monotone paths from each other?). The picture is fairly complete in dimension three, but plenty of open problems remain for high dimensional polytopes. </p> <p align=\"justify\">The new theorems presented in my talk come from three recent papers (in Arxiv), the first joint work with Moise Blanchard (MIT) and Quentin Louveaux (U. Liege) the second joint work with Christos Athanasiadis (U. Athens) and Zhenyang Zhang (UC Davis), the third with Sean Kafer (U. Waterloo) and Laura Sanita (Eidhoven U).</p>",

Given a sample (data) embedded in Euclidean space (or some more general space), the general pipeline is to build a distance based filtration and compute the corresponding persistence diagram. The standard way of proving results about the result is via the bottleneck stability of persistence diagrams. However, it turns out that in many cases this provides a highly pessimistic approximation result. In this talk, I will present recent results which show that the structure of an underlying space appears much earlier than expected and is remarkably stable. I will describe how these results fit into our understanding of the stability of persistence and show how the persistent approach can be useful in new ways. The talk will assume some passing familiarity with persistent homology and TDA but will not assume any previous knowledge about percolation. </p>",

      "keywords": ["reeb graph", "interleaving"],
      "abstract": "<p align=\"justify\">Reeb graphs and main other related graphical signatures have extensive use in applications, but only recently has there been intense interest in finding metrics for these objects. In this talk, we introduce an extension of smoothing on Reeb graphs, which we call truncated smoothing; this in turn allows us to define a new family of metrics which generalize the interleaving distance for Reeb graphs. Intuitively, we ``chop off'' parts near local minima and maxima during the course of smoothing. After formalizing truncation as a functor, we show that when applied after the smoothing functor, this prevents extensive expansion of the range of the function, and yields particularly nice properties (such as maintaining connectivity) when combined with smoothing. Further, for certain choices of the truncation parameter, we have additional structure which we can take advantage of to construct a categorical flow for any choice of slope <i>m</i> in <i>[0,1]</i>. Using the infrastructure built for a category with a flow, this then gives an interleaving distance for every <i>m</i> in <i>[0,1]</i>, which is a generalization of the original interleaving distance, which is the case <i>m=0</i>. While the resulting metrics are not stable, we show that any pair of these for <i>m,m'</i> in <i>[0,1)</i> are strongly equivalent metrics, which in turn gives stability of each metric up to a multiplicative constant. This talk is on joint work with Erin Chambers and Tim Ophelders. </p>",

To that end we introduce a new construction of complexes called selective Rips complexes. They can be thought of as custom made complexes designed to detect geodesic circles. It turns out that employing selective Rips complexes we can detect and locate a fairly large class of geodesic circles using one- and two-dimensional persistent homology.</p>",

Experiments in Lab and extensive numerical computations show that quantum vortices cross, each of them breaking into two parts and exchanging part of itself for part of the other. This phenomenon, known as quantum vortex reconnection, occurs even though the superfluid does not lose its smoothness. This usually leads to a change of topology of the quantum vortices. In this talk I will show that, given any initial and final congurations of quantum vortices (i.e. closed curves, possibly knotted and linked), and any way of transforming one into the other through a generic pseudo-Seifert surface embedded in spacetime, there is an initial condition whose associatedsolution realizes this specific vortex reconnection scenario. This allows us to track the vortex reconnection process at all times, both locally and globally. Key to prove this result is a new Runge-type approximation theorem for the linear Schrodinger equation.</p> <p>This is based on joint work with Alberto Enciso.</p>",

Neither of the cascades of this bimodal structure, in isolation, has the Richardson exponent of 1/3. If cascades are assumed to be initiated continuously and throughout space we obtain a model of the inertial range of stationary turbulence.

The vast majority of knotted proteins form simple knot-like structures with up to three crossings. However, there are a few examples of proteins having up to six crossings. Interestingly, even though they are not ubiquitous, knots in proteins have been conserved within species that are separated by millions of years of evolution. This might imply that knottiness provides some advantages to proteins but this theory is still being contested. Besides the role of knotting in proteins, the pathway that the backbone of a knotted protein follows to reach its native folded state is still an open question.  To this date, researchers have suggested several mechanisms for protein self-tying that are based on wet lab experiments, numerical simulations, mathematical theory or a combination of all the above.</p><p>In this talk, I will discuss how the theory of knotoids can be applied to characterize the topology of linear proteins. I will present the basics of the theory, some knotoids invariants, the computational pipeline that we developed for this, as well as our tabulation of knotoids. I will also present a statistical distance that we define on distrubitions of projections of a protein backbone seen as knotoids and I will show how this distance allows us to infer possible folding pathways of trefoil knotted proteins.
