Almost all applications aim to quantify the topology of data and use the resulting descriptors to build a model for classification or regression. Recently, a new line of applications emerged, one that uses topology to guide optimization and thus modify the data or the model directly. After reviewing the descriptive view of TDA, we will discuss the structure of the optimization problem and demonstrate how understanding it leads to better optimization algorithms.",

How can we infer the original metric and determine the manifold's topology? This talk introduces a density-based method for estimating topological features from data in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, assuming a manifold structure. The key to our approach lies in the Fermat distance, a sample metric that robustly infers the deformed Riemannian metric. Theoretical convergence results and implications in the homology inference of the manifold will be presented.

In our talk we will discuss a more general motion planning for parallel mechanisms. In particular, we will consider mechanisms that are redundant in the sense that the dimension of their joint space is strictly bigger than the dimension of their work space. The additional degrees of freedom allow motion paths that avoid critical configurations of joints, and we will discuss how difficult it is to construct predictable singularity-free motion plans that perform a given set of tasks.

In its original incarnation a persistence module is defined to be a functor from the poset of nonnegative real numbers with theory natural order to the category of vector spaces and homomorphisms. These are referred to as single parameter persistence modules and are a fundamental and useful concept in topological data analysis when the source data depends on a single parameter. The concept naturally lends itself to generalisation, and one may consider persistence modules as functors from an arbitrary poset (or more generally an arbitrary small category) to some abelian target category. In other words, a persistence module is simply a representation of the source category in the target abelian category. As such much research was dedicated to studying persistence modules in this context. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that when the source category is more general than a linear order, then its representation type is generally wild. In particular, keeping in mind that persistence module theory is supposed to be applicable, computability of general persistence modules is very limited. In this talk I will describe the background and motivation for persistence module theory and introduce a new set of ideas for local analysis of persistence module by methods borrowed from spectral graph theory and multivariable calculus.",

However, most existing GNNs have inherently static architectures, and as a result, do not explicitly account for time dependencies of the encoded knowledge and are limited in their ability to simultaneously infer latent time-conditioned relations among entities. We postulate that such hidden time-conditioned properties may be captured by the tools of multipersistence, i.e., an emerging machinery in topological data analysis which allows us to quantify dynamics of the data shape along multiple geometric dimensions. We propose to summarize inherent time-conditioned topological properties of the data as time-aware multipersistence Euler-Poincaré surface and prove its stability. We then construct a supragraph convolution module which simultaneously accounts for the extracted intra- and inter-dependencies in the data.  We illustrate the utility of the proposed approach in application to forecasting highway traffic flow, blockchain Ethereum token prices, and COVID-19 hospitalizations.",

They are pictorial representations of persistence homology modules and describe topological features of a data set at different scales. In this talk, I will discuss the geometry of spaces of persistence diagrams and connections with the theory of Alexandrov spaces, which are metric generalizations of complete Riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature bounded below. In particular, I will discuss how one can assign to a metric pair $(X,A)$ a one-parameter family of pointed metric spaces of (generalized) persistence diagrams $D_p(X,A)$ with points in $(X,A)$ via a family of functors $D_p$ with $p\\in [1,\\infty]$. These spaces are equipped with the p-Wasserstein distance when $p\\geq 1$ and the bottleneck distance when $p=\\infty$. The functors $D_p$ preserve natural metric properties of the space $X$, including non-negative curvature in the triangle comparison sense when $p=2$. When $p=\\infty$, the functor $D_\\infty$ is sequentially continuous with respect to a suitable notion of Gromov–Hausdorff convergence of metric pairs. When $(X,A) = (\\mathbb{R}^2,\\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$ is the diagonal of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, one recovers previously known properties of the usual spaces of persistence diagrams.

Hence one can attempt to describe the result of such a relaxation as a state that minimises the energy while preserving the magnetic helicity. Mathematically the relation between magnetic helicity and energy is defined by an inequality, $|H(B)| \\le (2/C) E(B)$, a result that was first shown in a classical paper by V.I. Arnold (1974) for simply connected domains. The formula shows how a non-trivial magnetic field topology (a non-zero helicity) forms a lower bound for the magnetic energy. The formula contains a constant C, which is the smallest possible eigenvalue of the curl operator in a magnetically closed domain. The corresponding eigenfield is a state of maximum helicity for a given energy. We will discuss under which circumstances these maximum helicity (minimum energy) states can be reached, show how Arnold’s formula can be applied to non-simply connected domains, and how one can modify Arnold’s formula to find lower bounds for the energy even if $H(B)=0$.</br></br>References:</br></br>-Arnold, V.I., The asymptotic Hopf invariant and its application, Sel.

A possible theoretical picture for this phenomenon is that hierarchy of topological complexity is closely related to spectrum of energy or other dynamical properties. For this study the following progress would be reviewed: (i) ropelengths/crossing numbers of prime knots and links versus the groundstate energy spectrum[7]; (ii) adapted HOMFLYPT polynomial values used to quantify complexity of torus knots and links[4][6][1]; (iii) complexity degree of a knot defined in a Legendre polynomial basis in a suitably defined knot polynomial space[5]. Some relevant undergoing numerical simulation work is introduced as well. Our emphasis will be placed on the role that topologically non-conservative transitions play in the evolution of a knot complex system, in the hope of finding a scalar topological invariant to manage energy or other spectrums.</br></br>This is joint work with Prof. Renzo L.

We will give a brief overview of curvature in graphs, define some relevant concepts, and show their utility for data science and machine learning applications. In particular, we shall discuss two applications: first, the use of curvature to *distinguish* between different models for synthesising new graphs from some unknown distribution; second, a novel *framework* for defining curvature for hypergraphs, whose structural properties require a more generic setting. We will also describe new applications that are specifically geared towards a treatment by curvature, thus underlining the utility of this concept for data science.",

Arrow's impossibility theorem (1951) proves that it is not possible to do it when we assume some apparently mild conditions. Fortunately, in some cases, aggregation is possible when the domain of individual preferences is restricted. That is, when voters can only report some preferences, good aggregation rules exist. However, no theorem characterizes the domains in which aggregation is possible, and the problem remains open.</br></br>Despite the Arrovian model being purely combinatorial, Baryshnikov (1993) used simplicial complexes and homology to prove Arrow's theorem and exposed a conjecture which characterized restricted domains through homology groups. The main drawback of using homology is that it is not affordable for most of the social scientists. Therefore, instead of homology, we have used combinatorial topology tools such as the Index Lemma (the combinatorial counterpart to Poincare's Lemma) to tackle the problem. First, we have proved the Arrow's impossibility theorem, showing that combinatorial topology is helpful for our purposes.</br></br>Second, we have characterized the domains allowing aggregation rules for the base case of two voters and three candidates. Our characterization proves that homology groups are not enough to characterize such domains. Our result gives us hope to obtain a general characterization of the good domains for aggregating preferences.

        "abstract": "A question that comes up repeatedly in recent developments on multi-parameter persistence is to define mathematically sound and computationally tractable notions of approximation for multi-parameter persistence modules. As $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is of wild representation type, one seeks to approximate arbitrary (say, finitely presentable) modules by modules coming from some subcategory that is easier to work with in practice. An obvious candidate subcategory is the one of interval-decomposable modules, whose summands are indicator modules of intervals (i.e. convex, connected subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, equipped with the product order). Indeed, interval-decomposable modules are convenient to work with, since they are easy to encode and manipulate on a computer, and to interpret visually. Several notions of module approximation using this subcategory have been proposed, among which the most common one seeks to preserve the rank invariant when switching from the original module to its interval-decomposable approximation. The motivation is that, the rank invariant being one of the weakest invariants available to us, preserving it is considered to be a minimum. As it turns out, this is not always possible, however one can always decompose the rank invariant of the module as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of rank invariants of interval modules. Thus, a weaker form of preservation of the rank invariant is possible, in which the interval summands are signed (hence the name 'signed rank decomposition'). This fact can be viewed as a consequence of the Moebius inversion formula, but more fundamentally, it can be obtained by working in  the Grothendieck group relative to an appropriate exact structure, where the rank invariant of the module becomes equal to the alternating sum of the rank invariants of the various terms in the module's minimal relative projective resolution. This alternative proof strategy offers some significant benefits: (1) it links the coefficients in the decomposition to the structure of the module, as in the 1-parameter setting; (2) it provides a roadmap to study their bottleneck stability; (3) it connects multi-parameter persistence to relative homological algebra, thereby paving the way towards the definition of more refined invariants for multi-parameter persistence modules using larger classes of projectives. The purpose of my talk will be to tell this story.",

This is a 2-dimensional analogue of the Burtin and Erd\u0151s-Spencer theorems characterizing the connectivity threshold for random graphs on the 1-skeleton of the n-dimensional cube. Our main result can also be seen as a cubical counterpart to the Linial-Meshulam theorem for random 2-dimensional simplicial complexes. However, the models exhibit strikingly different behaviors. We show that if p > 1 - \u221a1/2 \u2248 0.2929, then with high probability the fundamental group is a free group with one generator for every maximal 1-dimensional face. As a corollary, homology vanishing and simple connectivity have the same threshold. This is joint work with Matthew Kahle and Elliot Paquette.",

Several direct numerical simulations are carried out by employing a new numerical code [1] that resolves the limits of boundary conditions on a truncated domain. The head-on collision of quantum vortex rings and the creation of a trefoil knot from initially unlinked, unknotted loops are realized for the first time. Three generic scenarios are identified: (i) direct topological cascade and collapse, (ii) structural and topological cycles, and (iii) inverse topological cascade of complex structures. Thanks to defect localization, we can apply geometric and topological techniques to get physical insight on the dynamics of these evolutionary processes. Writhing number proves to be an appropriate detector of direct topological cascade that governs the decay of complex structures to small-scale vortex rings, whereas picks of total curvature provide a clear signature of reconnection events.

In some sense, any choice of (field line) helicity is equally meaningful, because all are invariant under ideal deformations that vanish on the boundary.

It turns out that the sequence of del Pezzo surfaces is not the only sequence of objects in mathematics which gives rise to the $E_k$ symmetry pattern. I will present a sequence of topological spaces, starting with the four-sphere $S^4$, and then forming its iterated cyclic loop spaces $L_c^k$ $S^4$, within which we will see the $E_k$ symmetry pattern via rational homotopy theory. For this sequence of spaces, the correspondence between its $E_k$ symmetry pattern and that of toroidal compactifications of M-theory is no longer a mystery, as each space $L_c^k$ $S^4$ is naturally related to the compactification of M-theory on the k-torus via identification of the equations of motion of (11-k)-dimensional supergravity as the defining equations of the Sullivan minimal model of Lck S4. This gives an explicit duality between rational homotopy theory and physics. Thereby, Iqbal, Neitzke, and Vafa\u2019s mysterious duality between algebraic geometry and physics is extended to a triality involving algebraic topology, with the duality between topology and physics demystified.

We define the individual helicity for each component of a link singularity, and prove that each individual helicity is zero if and only if there exists a Seifert framing for the link. We extend these results to multi-armed defects. We prove that under anti-parallel reconnection of framed defect strands that both twist and writhe helicity are conserved.</br></br><i>Co-authors: Christian E. Laing, Renzo L.

Recently, chemists working on developing novel materials have made substantial progress in synthesizing so-called \u201ctopological polymers\u201d which are modeled on more complicated graphs, including lassos, \u03b8-curves, and even $K_{3,3}$ and $K_4$. Predicting the material properties of these polymers in solution requires a mathematical theory of random embeddings of graphs. Such a theory was developed by James, Guth, and Flory [1,2,3] in the 20th century to study elasticity, but only with simple Gaussian interactions between monomers. This talk describes a generalization of that theory [4] which can handle arbitrary interaction potentials, including freely-jointed networks and steric interactions.</br></br><i>Joint with Jason Cantarella, Tetsuo Deguchi, and Erica Uehara. </i></br></br>[1] James, H.M., Guth, E. 1943 Theory of the elastic properties of rubber.

I will present two results: First that the winding can uniquely topologically classify certain types of braided fields [1] (this uniqueness is lost for the helicity). Second, that in continuum theories there are classes of vector fields for which the helicity can decay but the topology stays fixed [2]. In other words the two distinct components of the helicity have their own evolutionary rules.

In a non-rotating axially symmetric trap, the core of a single vortex precesses around the trap center and, at the same time, the phase of its wave function shifts at a constant rate. The precession velocity,  the speed of phase shift, and the distance between the vortex core and the trap center, depend continuously on the value of the conserved angular momentum that is carried by the entire condensate. The number of vortices increases with increasing angular momentum, and the vortices repel each other to form timecrystalline Abrikosov lattices. Poincar\u00e9 index formula states that besides vortices there are also saddle points, and the difference in the number of vortices and saddle points can never change. But unlike vortices the saddle points can also attract each other, they can join and become combined into timecrystalline degenerate critical point configurations. But when the number of saddle points becomes sufficiently large there is a transition, and instead of attracting each other, the saddle points start repelling each other, and pair up with vortices. The ensuing structures rotate around the trap center, in regular arrangements akin Abrikosov lattices [1].</br></br><i>This is joint work with Julien Garaud and Jin Dai. </i></br></br> [1] Garaud J., Dai J. and Niemi A.J. 2021 Vortex precession and exchange in a Bose-Einstein condensate.

The attention is paid to statistical properties of collapsed conformations with the fractal dimension $D_f \\geq 2$ in 3D, which are analyzed both numerically and via the mean-field Flory approach. Our study is motivated by an attempt to mimic the conformational statistics of collapsed unknotted polymer rings, which are known to equilibrate into the compact hierarchical crumpled globules (CG) with $D_f = 3$ at large scales. Replacing the topologically stabilized CG state by a self-avoiding fractal path adjusted to the fractal dimension $D_f \\approx 3$, we tremendously simplify the problem of generating the CG-like conformations since we wash out the topological constraints from the consideration. We show that, with the increase of $D_f$, typical conformations become more territorial and less knotted. Distributions of the knot complexity, $P(\\chi)$, for collapsed ring chains with $D_f \\geq 2$ suggest a direct correspondence between the fractal dimension and knotting of fractal paths.

In simply connected and magnetically closed domains, its definition is the integral, over the domain, of the dot product of the magnetic field with a vector potential of the magnetic field. This definition is gauge-invariant, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the vector potential. Often, however, it is necessary to consider magnetic helicity in multiply connected domains, such as a torus or a toroidal shell \u2013 two domains important in plasma physics. The standard definition of magnetic helicity in simply connected domains for any vector potential is no longer applicable in multiply connected domains as it is not gauge invariant. In this contribution, we present two main results. (1) The extension of the definition of magnetic helicity to bounded and multiply connected domains, making the definition gauge invariant. (2) The use of this extended definition to complete the landmark proof of Taylor\u2019s conjecture in [1], allowing for arbitrary vector potentials to be used in multiply connected domains.

The resistive term in the MHD equations is for most astrophysical and also many technical plasmas very small. If one neglects this term (ideal MHD), the equations have an infinite number of conserved quantities related to the conservation of the topology of the magnetic field. On the other hand, even with very small resistivity strong current sheets can develop in localised regions leading to magnetic reconnection. This raises the question which ideal invariants are still approximate invariants in the limit of small, but non-vanishing, resistivity. We will discuss a number of numerical relaxation experiments which we have performed on plasmas with complex, braided, magnetic fields to find out which invariants govern the relaxation process towards a minimum energy state.

It is well known that physical knots and links decay from a high-topological complexity state to a low-complexity state [1,2] and during evolution different dacaying paths can occur. A theoretical explanation of this phenomenon represents a fundamental open problem. Here we consider the spontaneous decay of Borromean superfluid rings governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Due to quantum reconnections [3] the system experiences a cascade path passing through midway stages forming a Whitehead link, a trefoil knot and a Hopf link, ultimately producing trivial loops. In particular, among the evolution paths, a new inverse cascade progress is observed in free evolution.

This is also the case for the dynamics of an ideal fluid. A proof to it is given in terms of variation of the Lagrangian label as a function of the Eulerian position [1,2]. In addition to the cross helicity, the total mass, the total entropy and the magnetic helicity are topological invariants. We construct the Nambu bracket for the ideal MHD with constant coefficients, using the three topological invariants other than the total mass as Hamiltonians, together with the total energy [3]. The Lie-Poisson bracket induced from the Nambu bracket gives an extension of the known one [4] and automatically guarantees the cross-helicity to be a Casimir invariant. The Casimir manifested by the Namb btacket, if specialized to a vortex filament, provides the recursion operator for producing the localized induction hierarchy.</br></br><i>This is joint work with Rong Zou (U.

These effects are studied by making use of Kleinert\u2019s multi-valued gauge theory [2, 3] under the zero helicity condition for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the presence of global twist we show that secondary defects must be produced consistently with the zero-linking number requirement.

In quantum fluids its rigorous definition needs an appropriate adjustment due to the lack of regularity for the presence of defects. As shown by Salman [1], and subsequently proven using topological arguments by Sumners et al. [2], helicity can be demonstrated to be invariably zero for systems that admit Seifert framing. A typical example of such systems is given by quantum vortex defects governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In this case an attempted proof of zero-helicity using Noether theorem was given by Kedia et al. [3]. Their demonstration, however, has several inconsistencies.

In quantum fluids, any rotational motion is constrained by quantum mechanics to individual (discrete) vortex lines of fixed (quantised) strength [1]. This is unlike what happens in ordinary fluids, where vorticity is a continuous field. Quantum turbulence, created by stirring a quantum fluid, is thus conceptually simpler than ordinary turbulence, consisting of a tangle of individual vortex lines rather than a disordered continuous vorticity field.

In particular, I will present bounds on the amount of global entanglement as measured by both the writhe and absolute writhe. With these bounds, we can produce realistically folded structures from BioSAXS data[1] with a much higher chance of success when passed into an MD simulation.

Geometric and topological descriptors of virus architecture, combined with stochastic simulations, reveal how viruses navigate the knife\u2019s edge between stability and instability, guaranteeing protection for their genetic cargo while also enabling its timely release. Models of virus architecture also provide a novel perspective on open problems in virus assembly. This includes the origin and control of polymorphic particle assembly, which arises, amongst others, when virus-derived protein containers are functionalised to present antigens for applications in vaccinology. They moreover play an instrumental role in the discovery of genome- encoded virus assembly instructions.

The first one \u2013 known as over-squashing \u2013 is unavoidable in the MPNN class and concerns the input graph topology. This relates to how information propagates in a graph. We show that discrete curvature quantities (old and new) could help us understand where messages are being lost and we can provably characterize the over-squashing phenomenon in terms of curvature. The second problem consists in analysing GNNs as multi-particle dynamics using the lens of gradient flows of an energy. We investigate what happens when instead of learning the MPNN equations we learn an energy and then let the equations follow the gradient flow of such energy. This allows us to understand further the role of the channel-mixing matrix that is ubiquitous in standard graph convolutional models as a bilinear potential inducing both attraction and repulsion along edges via its positive and negative eigenvalues respectively.",

Another branch of knot theory is concerned with invariants that have connections to 4-manifolds, for example the knot signature and Heegaard Floer homology. In my talk, I will describe a new relationship between these two fields that was discovered with the aid of machine learning. Specifically, we show that the knot signature can be estimated surprisingly accurately in terms of hyperbolic invariants. We introduce a new real-valued invariant called the natural slope of a hyperbolic knot in the 3-sphere, which is defined in terms of its cusp geometry. Our main result is that twice the knot signature and the natural slope differ by at most a constant times the hyperbolic volume divided by the cube of the injectivity radius. This theorem has applications to Dehn surgery and to 4-ball genus. We will also present a refined version of the inequality where the upper bound is a linear function of the volume, and the slope is corrected by terms corresponding to short geodesics that have odd linking number with the knot. My talk will outline the proofs of these results, as well as describing the role that machine learning played in their discovery. </br> This is joint work with Alex Davies, Andras Juhasz, and Nenad Tomasev.",

Particular focus will be on understanding parametrised families of such feature maps, such as those stable with respect to p-Wasserstein distance. The use of Wasserstein stable features will be illustrated on real world and artificial datasets.",

Such a pair can be collapsed by removal of the two simplices and all simplices between them \u2013 think about an edge in a solid tetrahedron; collapsing means removing the edge, the interior of the tetrahedron and the interior of the two faces containing that edge. This leads to a homotopy equivalence. There is a similar notion for cubical complexes. A sequence of collapses leads to a simpler (fewer simplices/cubes) space.\nFor a directed space, which is a topological space with a selected set of paths, the directed paths, directed homotopy equivalence is a very strong requirement, and not what should be the basis of collapsing.\nWe study the following setting: A Euclidean Cubical Complex, an ECC, is a subset of R^n which is a union of elementary cubes. An elementary cube is a product of n intervals [ai,ai+e], where e is either 0 or 1. A directed path in an ECC is continuous and non-decreasing in all coordinates.\nWe define a notion of collapse with the aim of preserving various properties of spaces of directed paths.\nThis is joint work with the WiT, Women in Topology, group R.

The neurons in such networks exhibit intricate patterns of connectivity whose structure controls the allowed patterns of neural activity. In this work, we examine inhibitory threshold-linear networks (TLNs) whose dynamics are constrained by an underlying directed graph. We develop a set of parameter-independent graph rules that enable us to predict features of the dynamics, such as emergent sequences and dynamic attractors, from properties of the graph. These rules provide a direct link between the structure and function of inhibition-dominated networks, yielding new insights into how connectivity shapes dynamics in real neural circuits. Recently, we have used these ideas to classify dynamic attractors in a two-parameter family of TLNs spanning all 9608 directed graphs of size n=5. Remarkably, we find a striking modularity in the dynamic attractors, with identical or near-identical attractors arising in networks that are otherwise dynamically inequivalent. This suggests that, just as one can store multiple static patterns as stable fixed points in a Hopfield model, a variety of dynamic attractors can also be embedded in TLNs in a modular fashion.",

Ecologists have focused on characterizing the \"limits\" of species coexistence ---that is, the maximum number of different species that can coexist under given constraints. Yet, little is known about the structure of species coexistence below such limits. Namely, is it possible to assemble an ecological system by adding one species at a time until reaching the coexistence limits? Or is it possible to find obstructions where species coexistence abruptly breaks before reaching the limits? To address these questions, we built a novel formalism based on hypergraphs and Algebraic Topology to show that, below its limits, species coexistence in ecological systems has ubiquitous obstructions that we call \"coexistence holes\". A coexistence hole occurs during an assembly process when a species collection does not coexist, although we can assemble it from sub-collections that coexist. Using theoretical and experimental ecological systems, we provide direct evidence showing that coexistence holes obey regularities. Namely, their diversity is constrained by the internal structure of species interactions, while their frequency can be explained by external factors acting on these systems. Overall, our work provides one of the first applications of Algebraic Topology to Ecology, unveiling how biodiversity is a discontinuous process driven by internal design constraints. </p><p>This is joint work with Aaron Kelley (IM-UNAM), Luis Montejano (IM-UNAM), Chuliang Song (McGill/Toronto University) and Serguei Saavedra (MIT).</br><p>References: </br>[1] Angulo, Marco Tulio, et al. \"Coexistence holes characterize the assembly and disassembly of multispecies systems.\" Nature Ecology & Evolution (2021): 1-11.</br>[2] Letten, A.

Formally these interrogations translate into the following inverse problem: Given an element in the image of PH, a so-called barcode D, what is the fiber (pre-image) of PH over D? There are several ways of defining PH: for point clouds in a metric space, for filter functions on a simplicial complex and for continuous functions on an arbitrary space, to name a few. Hence there are as many inverse problems to address. In this talk I will review the simplicial situation as well as that of Morse functions on a smooth manifold, with the aim of showing some geometrically surprising fibers and transmitting my interest for these intricate inverse problems.

We find that there are a number of possible such categories, each with its own particular homotopy theory and associated homologies, and, additionally, that there is a generalization of the coarse category which allows finite sets to be non-trivial (i.e. not 'coarsely' equivalent to a point). We will give an overview of these theories and several applications, show how they are related to familiar objects in applied topology, such as the Vietoris-Rips homology, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Our results suggest that the twist, which increases with <i>Re</i>, plays a more important role in helicity dynamics than recognized before, particularly at high <i>Re</i>. <br/><br/> <b>Note:</b>  the video of this web-seminar combines the contributions by Fazle Hussain (I part) and <a href=\"https://seminargeotop-a.com/previous-talks/56\">Jie Yao</a> (II part).",

These large and intricate molecules perform the vast majority of the biological functions of life and the structures of over 170,000 proteins have been determined and are stored in the Protein Databank. A detailed understanding of their structures has gradually emerged over the last 50 years. Chirality within protein structures is observed at all 'levels' of structure, starting with the basic stereochemistry of the polypeptide chain, through local chain folding, to the 'tertiary' structure of the whole chain and even to chirality of large complexes.",

Despite the ubiquity and importance of supercoiling in regulating nearly every aspect of DNA activity, relatively little is known about how. To determine how supercoiling influenced DNA shape, we determined the 3-D structures of individual 336 bp DNA minicircles over a wide range of supercoiling from s = -0.019 to +0.085 (Irobalieva et al. 2015). Supercoiled DNA forms far more bent and contorted shapes than predicted. We sought to understand how DNA formed these shapes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (Wang et al. 2017), which predicted that site-specific disruptions to base pairing may explain otherwise energetically unfavorable sharp DNA bends. Likewise, bending strain at the apices of highly writhed DNA circles leads to broken base pairs. Probing for and mapping where base-pair disruptions occur, we discovered that negative supercoiling transmits mechanical stress along the DNA backbone to disrupt base pairing at specific distant sites (Fogg et al. 2021). This unprecedented base-pair disruption cooperativity among distant sites localizes certain sequences to superhelical apices to facilitate DNA writhing and relieve torsional strain, likely preventing more extensive denaturation that can cause genomic instability. We also discovered how cells may exploit DNA looping to position DNA nicks to facilitate repair. Our data explain how DNA can form short loops through base-pair disruption and reveal a complex interplay between looping- and supercoiling-mediated site-specific disruptions to base pairing and the 3-D conformation of DNA, which influence how genomes are stored, replicated, transcribed, repaired, and likely other aspects of DNA activity. We hope to harness these looping- and supercoiling-mediated site-specific denaturation and mechanical correlations to design novel DNA shapes for nanotechnology.</p><p>Irobalieva, R.N.*, Fogg, J.M.*, Catanese, D.J., Sutthibutpong, T., Chen, M., Barker, A.K., Ludtke, S.J., Harris, S.A., Schmid, M.F., Chiu, W., and Zechiedrich, L.

We prove that the resulting decomposition is the unique minimal stratification for which the strata are homogeneous and the given sheaf is constructible. In particular, when we choose to work with the local homology sheaf, our algorithm gives an alternative to the local homology transfer algorithm given in Bendich et al. (2012), and the cohomology stratification algorithm given in Nanda (2020). Additionally, we give examples of stratifications based on the geometric techniques of Breiding et al. (2018), illustrating how the sheaf-theoretic approach can be used to study stratifications from both topological and geometric perspectives. This approach also points toward future applications of sheaf theory in the study of topological data analysis by illustrating the utility of the language of sheaf theory generalizing existing algorithms.

        "abstract": "<p>Quantum computation can be regarded as a methodical study of the structure preparation, evolution, and measurement of quantum systems in a computational framework. In a quantum system, a physical state corresponds to a unit length vector in a complex space (Hilbert space or finite dimensional complex space depending on the problem). A physical process corresponds to the application of a unitary transformation to a state. A measurement of a state projects that state to one of a number of orthogonal possibilities represented by an orthonormal basis for the complex space. The probability of a measurement is the absolute square of its coefficient in the state vector. A quantum computer consists in a unitary transformation and the capability to prepare states, apply the unitary transformation and measure the results. The statistics of repeated measurement gives the information for the computation. Thus the key to quantum computing is the design of unitary transformations that can accomplish a particular task. There are a number of designs that are very interesting such as Shor\u2019s method of factoring integers on a quantum computer. The design of actual quantum computers is very difficult because it is hard to control measurement and keep the system from decohering in its interaction with the environment. It is thought that topological physical situations, such as the behaviour of anyons in the quantum Hall effect or the behaviour of Majorana Fermions in nano wires, may hold the key to the desired fault tolerant computation. In both of these instances one can formulate the unitary transformations in terms of representations of the Artin Braid group that are related to the physics of the situation. It is thought that such topological phases of physical systems will be resistant to perturbation and will make scalable quantum computing possible. It is the purpose of this talk to describe braiding related to both the quantum Hall effect (the Fibonacci model) and unitary braiding related to Majorana Fermions (braiding from Clifford algebras). The talk will be self-contained and as pictorial as possible. </p>",

Although this number is small relative to the total number of protein structures solved, it is remarkably high given the fact that for decades it was thought impossible for a protein chain to fold and thread in such a way as to create a knotted structure. There are four different types of knotted protein structures that contain 31, 41, 52 and 61 knots and over the past 15 years there has been an increasing number of experimental and computational studies on these systems. The folding pathways of knotted proteins have been studied in some detail, however, the focus of this talk is to address the fundamental question \u201cWhy are there knots in proteins?\u201d It is known that once formed, knotted protein structures tend to be conserved by nature. This, in addition to the fact that, at least for some deeply knotted proteins, their folding rates are slow compared with many unknotted proteins, has led to the hypothesis that there are some properties of knotted proteins that are different from unknotted ones, and that this had resulted in some evolutionary advantage over faster folding unknotted structures. In this talk, I will review the evidence for and against this theory. In particular, how a knot within a protein chain may affect the thermodynamic, kinetic, mechanical and cellular (resistance to degradation) stability of the protein will be discussed. </p>",

A message consists of data that have to be sent to a destination node, i.e. the message itself plus a finite amount of space that keeps only a constant amount of data to aid a message to reach its destination, e.g. the address of the starting and destination nodes, a constant number of nodes visited, etc. Local means that at each site we have at our disposal only local information regarding a node and its neighbors, i.e. no global knowledge of the network is available at any time, other that the network is planar and connected.

The local action of site-specific recombinases is a reconnection event which is modeled mathematically as a band surgery. The banding is coherent or non-coherent, depending on the relative orientation of the recombination sites. We use tools from low dimensional topology to investigate the mechanism of action of these enzymes, and we complement the analytical work with computer simulations.

We will prove a theorem that describes the asymptotic behavior of the expected radius of gyration for large graphs of fixed topology in terms of the degree-Kirchhoff index of the graph.

In applications where an anisotropic mesh is desired, a standard approach is to consider a Riemannian metric defined over the domain and to construct an approximate Delaunay triangulation with respect to this metric.</p> <p>In the case of surfaces, it has been shown that a Delaunay triangulation exists if the set of sample points is sufficiently dense but this is no longer true in higher dimensional manifolds: sample density alone is not sufficient to ensure that the Delaunay complex is a triangulation. To walk around this difficulty, we first introduce perturbation algorithms in Euclidean space that make the Delaunay triangulation of well-distributed point sets quantifiably stable with respect to perturbations of the metric or of the point positions. We then adapt this Euclidean perturbation algorithm to the context of compact manifolds equipped with a metric that can be locally approximated by a Euclidean metric. In particular, this includes Riemannian metrics, as well as the extrinsic metric on submanifolds variations of which have been exploited in algorithms for reconstructing submanifolds of Euclidean space from a finite set of sample points. The simplicial complex produced by our algorithm is naturally equipped with a piecewise flat metric that is a quantifiably good approximation to the metric on the original manifold. </p>",

The ability of cells to control DNA topology is essential for their survival, and topology also controls the geometrical properties of the molecule which influence its function. Advances in the theory of DNA elasticity clarified our understanding of this role and other phenomena associated with biological function and storage of DNA. Classical elastic rod models have been applied to DNA supercoiling, knotting, and cyclization, while base-pair level models of DNA made it possible to incorporate the effects of nucleotide sequence and the negative charge of DNA in new mesoscale models of complex DNA-protein assemblies, which yielded insights into the role of DNA deformability in gene regulation. More recently, simulations of the dynamics of elastic rods submerged in a viscous incompressible fluid has been conducted in order to gain understanding of the behavior of topologically constrained DNA molecules. This lecture will give an overview of recent research on the above topics. </p>",

For this the Hamiltonian needs to support conserved charges, and the occurrence of a time crystal becomes relates to the wider concept of spontaneously broken symmetries. Except that in the case of a time crystal, the symmetry breaking takes place in a dynamical context.

Because linear programs (LPs) appear in all areas of application the Simplex methods was elected as one of the top 10 algorithms in the 20th century. Surprisingly, despite its popularity and almost 80 years of research we still do not fully understand its complexity and behavior. </p>  <p>To bound the number of iterations of the Simplex method we take a geometric point of view and investigate the possible lengths of monotone paths inside the oriented graphs of polyhedra (oriented by the objective function). We are interested in both the shortest and the longest monotone paths possible and estimate the (monotone) diameter and the height of some famous combinatorial polyhedra (such as TSP, fractional matching polytopes, and others). But how far apart are two monotone paths of an LP? E.g., if I use two pivot rules the Simplex method traces two paths, is there a notion of distance between them?. As we look at all monotone paths together we see a metric space structure which can be used to count how many are there or to generate them randomly. This comes from a very natural graph (the flip-path graph) and CW complex structures (cellular-strings complex) on the set of monotone paths These objects are important in topological combinatorics (Baues complexes and polyhedral subdivisions studied by Billera, Sturmfels, Gelfand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky and others in the early 1990\u2019s) and in discrete optimization (In particular the complexity of the simplex method with work going back to Klee). In my talk I will discuss some natural counting problems associated with the discrete geometric situation. Our main enumerative results include bounds on the number of monotone paths, and on the the diameter of the space of monotone paths (how far are two monotone paths from each other?). The picture is fairly complete in dimension three, but plenty of open problems remain for high dimensional polytopes. </p> <p>The new theorems presented in my talk come from three recent papers (in Arxiv), the first joint work with Moise Blanchard (MIT) and Quentin Louveaux (U.

The standard way of proving results about the result is via the bottleneck stability of persistence diagrams. However, it turns out that in many cases this provides a highly pessimistic approximation result. In this talk, I will present recent results which show that the structure of an underlying space appears much earlier than expected and is remarkably stable. I will describe how these results fit into our understanding of the stability of persistence and show how the persistent approach can be useful in new ways.

In this talk, we introduce an extension of smoothing on Reeb graphs, which we call truncated smoothing; this in turn allows us to define a new family of metrics which generalize the interleaving distance for Reeb graphs. Intuitively, we ``chop off'' parts near local minima and maxima during the course of smoothing. After formalizing truncation as a functor, we show that when applied after the smoothing functor, this prevents extensive expansion of the range of the function, and yields particularly nice properties (such as maintaining connectivity) when combined with smoothing. Further, for certain choices of the truncation parameter, we have additional structure which we can take advantage of to construct a categorical flow for any choice of slope <i>m</i> in <i>[0,1]</i>. Using the infrastructure built for a category with a flow, this then gives an interleaving distance for every <i>m</i> in <i>[0,1]</i>, which is a generalization of the original interleaving distance, which is the case <i>m=0</i>. While the resulting metrics are not stable, we show that any pair of these for <i>m,m'</i> in <i>[0,1)</i> are strongly equivalent metrics, which in turn gives stability of each metric up to a multiplicative constant.

        "abstract": "<p>Polymer physics principles heavily rely on the assumption that polymers do not change topology (or architecture) in time. This is not the case for DNA, which is constantly topologically re-arranged within the cell nucleus. Inspired by this, I propose to study entangled systems of polymers which can selectively alter their topology and architecture in time and may expend energy to do so. I argue that solutions of these 'topologically active (living) polymers' can display unconventional viscoelastic behaviours and can be conveniently realised using solutions of DNA functionalised by certain families of proteins. </p> <p>In this talk I will present my first excursion into this field and present some recent results on the microrheology of entangled Lambda DNA undergoing digestion by restriction enzymes. Finally, I will discuss some wild conjectures and speculations about possible future directions.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>The quantum vortices of a superfluid are described as nodal lines of a solution to the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Experiments in Lab and extensive numerical computations show that quantum vortices cross, each of them breaking into two parts and exchanging part of itself for part of the other. This phenomenon, known as quantum vortex reconnection, occurs even though the superfluid does not lose its smoothness. This usually leads to a change of topology of the quantum vortices. In this talk I will show that, given any initial and final congurations of quantum vortices (i.e. closed curves, possibly knotted and linked), and any way of transforming one into the other through a generic pseudo-Seifert surface embedded in spacetime, there is an initial condition whose associatedsolution realizes this specific vortex reconnection scenario. This allows us to track the vortex reconnection process at all times, both locally and globally. Key to prove this result is a new Runge-type approximation theorem for the linear Schrodinger equation.</p> <p>This is based on joint work with Alberto Enciso.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>In this talk we develop a simple toy model of the inertial range of turbulent flow, based upon a cascade of vortical filaments. The filaments are taken to be helical, one turn of the helix playing the role of a turbulent eddy. A binary branching structure is proposed, involving the splitting of filaments at each step into pairs of daughter filaments with differing properties, in effect two distinct simultaneous cascades. Neither of the cascades of this bimodal structure, in isolation, has the Richardson exponent of 1/3. If cascades are assumed to be initiated continuously and throughout space we obtain a model of the inertial range of stationary turbulence. We impose the constraint associated with Kolmogorov's four-fifths law and then adjust the splitting to achieve good agreement with the observed structure exponents <i>zeta<sub>p</sub></i>. The presence of two simultaneous cascades is responsible for the nonlinear dependence of <i>zeta<sub>p</sub></i> upon <i>p</i>. We also consider the initial value problem and study the flow of energy to small scales.</p><p>This is joint work with Andrew Gilbert.</p>",

The vast majority of knotted proteins form simple knot-like structures with up to three crossings. However, there are a few examples of proteins having up to six crossings. Interestingly, even though they are not ubiquitous, knots in proteins have been conserved within species that are separated by millions of years of evolution. This might imply that knottiness provides some advantages to proteins but this theory is still being contested. Besides the role of knotting in proteins, the pathway that the backbone of a knotted protein follows to reach its native folded state is still an open question. To this date, researchers have suggested several mechanisms for protein self-tying that are based on wet lab experiments, numerical simulations, mathematical theory or a combination of all the above.</p><p>In this talk, I will discuss how the theory of knotoids can be applied to characterize the topology of linear proteins. I will present the basics of the theory, some knotoids invariants, the computational pipeline that we developed for this, as well as our tabulation of knotoids. I will also present a statistical distance that we define on distributions of projections of a protein backbone seen as knotoids and I will show how this distance allows us to infer possible folding pathways of trefoil knotted proteins. I will close this talk by briefly discussing applications of knot theory to genomics. </p>",
