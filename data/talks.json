        "abstract": "The search for the Theory of Everything has led to superstring theory, which then led physics, first to algebraic/differential geometry/topology, and then to computational geometry, and now to data science. With a concrete playground of the geometric landscape, accumulated by the collaboration of physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists over the last 4 decades, we show how the latest techniques in machine-learning can help explore problems of interest to theoretical physics and to pure mathematics. At the core of our programme is the question: how can AI help us with mathematics?",

        "abstract": "Many networks in the brain possess an abundance of inhibition, which serves to shape and stabilize neural dynamics. The neurons in such networks exhibit intricate patterns of connectivity whose structure controls the allowed patterns of neural activity. In this work, we examine inhibitory threshold-linear networks (TLNs) whose dynamics are constrained by an underlying directed graph. We develop a set of parameter-independent graph rules that enable us to predict features of the dynamics, such as emergent sequences and dynamic attractors, from properties of the graph. These rules provide a direct link between the structure and function of inhibition-dominated networks, yielding new insights into how connectivity shapes dynamics in real neural circuits. Recently, we have used these ideas to classify dynamic attractors in a two-parameter family of TLNs spanning all 9608 directed graphs of size n=5. Remarkably, we find a striking modularity in the dynamic attractors, with identical or near-identical attractors arising in networks that are otherwise dynamically inequivalent. This suggests that, just as one can store multiple static patterns as stable fixed points in a Hopfield model, a variety of dynamic attractors can also be embedded in TLNs in a modular fashion.",

        "abstract": "<p>A central challenge of Ecology is to explain the enormous biodiversity of species that we find on Earth, from the diversity of plant and animal species that stably coexist in tropical forests to the variety of microbial species that coexist in our gut. Ecologists have focused on characterizing the \"limits\" of species coexistence ---that is, the maximum number of different species that can coexist under given constraints. Yet, little is known about the structure of species coexistence below such limits. Namely, is it possible to assemble an ecological system by adding one species at a time until reaching the coexistence limits? Or is it possible to find obstructions where species coexistence abruptly breaks before reaching the limits? To address these questions, we built a novel formalism based on hypergraphs and Algebraic Topology to show that, below its limits, species coexistence in ecological systems has ubiquitous obstructions that we call \"coexistence holes\". A coexistence hole occurs during an assembly process when a species collection does not coexist, although we can assemble it from sub-collections that coexist. Using theoretical and experimental ecological systems, we provide direct evidence showing that coexistence holes obey regularities. Namely, their diversity is constrained by the internal structure of species interactions, while their frequency can be explained by external factors acting on these systems. Overall, our work provides one of the first applications of Algebraic Topology to Ecology, unveiling how biodiversity is a discontinuous process driven by internal design constraints. </p><p>This is joint work with Aaron Kelley (IM-UNAM), Luis Montejano (IM-UNAM), Chuliang Song (McGill/Toronto University) and Serguei Saavedra (MIT).</br><p>References: </br>[1] Angulo, Marco Tulio, et al. \"Coexistence holes characterize the assembly and disassembly of multispecies systems.\" Nature Ecology & Evolution (2021): 1-11.</br>[2] Letten, A.

To mathematicians, this is a natural generalization of the configuration space of points, perhaps interesting for its own sake. But is also important from the point of view of physics––physicists might call such a space the \"phase space\" or \"energy landscape\" for a hard-spheres system. Since hard-spheres systems are observed experimentally to undergo phase transitions (analogous to water changing into ice), it would be quite interesting to understand topological underpinnings of such transitions. <br/> We have just started to understand the homology of these configuration spaces, and based on our results so far we suggest working definitions of \"homological solid, liquid, and gas\".

In order to get a systematic understanding of the data science scenarios where PH is successful, it is crucial to know about its discriminative power, i.e. the ability to identify and disambiguate patterns in the data, or in other words it is crucial to know about the information loss and the invariances of PH. Formally these interrogations translate into the following inverse problem: Given an element in the image of PH, a so-called barcode D, what is the fiber (pre-image) of PH over D? There are several ways of defining PH: for point clouds in a metric space, for filter functions on a simplicial complex and for continuous functions on an arbitrary space, to name a few. Hence there are as many inverse problems to address. In this talk I will review the simplicial situation as well as that of Morse functions on a smooth manifold, with the aim of showing some geometrically surprising fibers and transmitting my interest for these intricate inverse problems.

We find that there are a number of possible such categories, each with its own particular homotopy theory and associated homologies, and, additionally, that there is a generalization of the coarse category which allows finite sets to be non-trivial (i.e. not 'coarsely' equivalent to a point). We will give an overview of these theories and several applications, show how they are related to familiar objects in applied topology, such as the Vietoris-Rips homology, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. We finish by describing a recent construction of sheaf theory in the category of Cech closure spaces, a strict generalization of the category of topological spaces.",

Despite the ubiquity and importance of supercoiling in regulating nearly every aspect of DNA activity, relatively little is known about how. To determine how supercoiling influenced DNA shape, we determined the 3-D structures of individual 336 bp DNA minicircles over a wide range of supercoiling from s = -0.019 to +0.085 (Irobalieva et al. 2015). Supercoiled DNA forms far more bent and contorted shapes than predicted. We sought to understand how DNA formed these shapes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (Wang et al. 2017), which predicted that site-specific disruptions to base pairing may explain otherwise energetically unfavorable sharp DNA bends. Likewise, bending strain at the apices of highly writhed DNA circles leads to broken base pairs. Probing for and mapping where base-pair disruptions occur, we discovered that negative supercoiling transmits mechanical stress along the DNA backbone to disrupt base pairing at specific distant sites (Fogg et al. 2021). This unprecedented base-pair disruption cooperativity among distant sites localizes certain sequences to superhelical apices to facilitate DNA writhing and relieve torsional strain, likely preventing more extensive denaturation that can cause genomic instability. We also discovered how cells may exploit DNA looping to position DNA nicks to facilitate repair. Our data explain how DNA can form short loops through base-pair disruption and reveal a complex interplay between looping- and supercoiling-mediated site-specific disruptions to base pairing and the 3-D conformation of DNA, which influence how genomes are stored, replicated, transcribed, repaired, and likely other aspects of DNA activity.

In particular, when we choose to work with the local homology sheaf, our algorithm gives an alternative to the local homology transfer algorithm given in Bendich et al.

In this talk, I will analyze the link between the 3D genome organization and gene expression using geometric packing models and autoencoders/deep learning. In particular, I will first discuss the Euclidean distance geometry problem arising when studying the 3D genome organization and show that higher-order contacts are needed for its reconstruction. I will then discuss how autoencoders can be used to translate between DNA packing images and gene expression at the single-cell level as well as between different cell types. Given the empirical benefits of over-parameterization in autoencoders for these applications, I will end with a theoretical analysis of autoencoders linking over-parameterization to attractor properties. Understanding the geometry of these basins of attraction remains an important open problem. ",

Some enzymes pass DNA through itself via enzyme-bridged transient breaks in the DNA; other enzymes break the DNA apart and reconnect it to different ends. In the topological approach to enzymology, circular DNA is incubated with an enzyme, producing an enzyme signature in the form of DNA knots and links. By observing the changes in DNA geometry (supercoiling) and topology (knotting and linking) due to enzyme action, the enzyme binding and mechanism can often be characterized. This talk will discuss topological models for DNA strand passage and exchange, including the analysis of site-specific recombination experiments on circular DNA and the analysis of packing geometry of DNA in viral capsids. </p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Quantum computation can be regarded as a methodical study of the structure preparation, evolution, and measurement of quantum systems in a computational framework. In a quantum system, a physical state corresponds to a unit length vector in a complex space (Hilbert space or finite dimensional complex space depending on the problem). A physical process corresponds to the application of a unitary transformation to a state. A measurement of a state projects that state to one of a number of orthogonal possibilities represented by an orthonormal basis for the complex space. The probability of a measurement is the absolute square of its coefficient in the state vector. A quantum computer consists in a unitary transformation and the capability to prepare states, apply the unitary transformation and measure the results. The statistics of repeated measurement gives the information for the computation. Thus the key to quantum computing is the design of unitary transformations that can accomplish a particular task. There are a number of designs that are very interesting such as Shor\u2019s method of factoring integers on a quantum computer. The design of actual quantum computers is very difficult because it is hard to control measurement and keep the system from decohering in its interaction with the environment. It is thought that topological physical situations, such as the behaviour of anyons in the quantum Hall effect or the behaviour of Majorana Fermions in nano wires, may hold the key to the desired fault tolerant computation. In both of these instances one can formulate the unitary transformations in terms of representations of the Artin Braid group that are related to the physics of the situation. It is thought that such topological phases of physical systems will be resistant to perturbation and will make scalable quantum computing possible. It is the purpose of this talk to describe braiding related to both the quantum Hall effect (the Fibonacci model) and unitary braiding related to Majorana Fermions (braiding from Clifford algebras). The talk will be self-contained and as pictorial as possible. </p>",

Although this number is small relative to the total number of protein structures solved, it is remarkably high given the fact that for decades it was thought impossible for a protein chain to fold and thread in such a way as to create a knotted structure. There are four different types of knotted protein structures that contain 31, 41, 52 and 61 knots and over the past 15 years there has been an increasing number of experimental and computational studies on these systems. The folding pathways of knotted proteins have been studied in some detail, however, the focus of this talk is to address the fundamental question \u201cWhy are there knots in proteins?\u201d It is known that once formed, knotted protein structures tend to be conserved by nature. This, in addition to the fact that, at least for some deeply knotted proteins, their folding rates are slow compared with many unknotted proteins, has led to the hypothesis that there are some properties of knotted proteins that are different from unknotted ones, and that this had resulted in some evolutionary advantage over faster folding unknotted structures. In this talk, I will review the evidence for and against this theory. In particular, how a knot within a protein chain may affect the thermodynamic, kinetic, mechanical and cellular (resistance to degradation) stability of the protein will be discussed. </p>",

The local action of site-specific recombinases is a reconnection event which is modeled mathematically as a band surgery. The banding is coherent or non-coherent, depending on the relative orientation of the recombination sites. We use tools from low dimensional topology to investigate the mechanism of action of these enzymes, and we complement the analytical work with computer simulations.

It plays a central role in the development of algorithms for meshing Euclidean domains. In applications where an anisotropic mesh is desired, a standard approach is to consider a Riemannian metric defined over the domain and to construct an approximate Delaunay triangulation with respect to this metric.</p> <p>In the case of surfaces, it has been shown that a Delaunay triangulation exists if the set of sample points is sufficiently dense but this is no longer true in higher dimensional manifolds: sample density alone is not sufficient to ensure that the Delaunay complex is a triangulation. To walk around this difficulty, we first introduce perturbation algorithms in Euclidean space that make the Delaunay triangulation of well-distributed point sets quantifiably stable with respect to perturbations of the metric or of the point positions. We then adapt this Euclidean perturbation algorithm to the context of compact manifolds equipped with a metric that can be locally approximated by a Euclidean metric. In particular, this includes Riemannian metrics, as well as the extrinsic metric on submanifolds variations of which have been exploited in algorithms for reconstructing submanifolds of Euclidean space from a finite set of sample points. The simplicial complex produced by our algorithm is naturally equipped with a piecewise flat metric that is a quantifiably good approximation to the metric on the original manifold. </p>",

        "abstract": "<p>George Dantzig\u2019s Simplex method is a work horse of modern computational mathematics. Because linear programs (LPs) appear in all areas of application the Simplex methods was elected as one of the top 10 algorithms in the 20th century. Surprisingly, despite its popularity and almost 80 years of research we still do not fully understand its complexity and behavior. </p>  <p>To bound the number of iterations of the Simplex method we take a geometric point of view and investigate the possible lengths of monotone paths inside the oriented graphs of polyhedra (oriented by the objective function). We are interested in both the shortest and the longest monotone paths possible and estimate the (monotone) diameter and the height of some famous combinatorial polyhedra (such as TSP, fractional matching polytopes, and others). But how far apart are two monotone paths of an LP? E.g., if I use two pivot rules the Simplex method traces two paths, is there a notion of distance between them?. As we look at all monotone paths together we see a metric space structure which can be used to count how many are there or to generate them randomly. This comes from a very natural graph (the flip-path graph) and CW complex structures (cellular-strings complex) on the set of monotone paths These objects are important in topological combinatorics (Baues complexes and polyhedral subdivisions studied by Billera, Sturmfels, Gelfand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky and others in the early 1990\u2019s) and in discrete optimization (In particular the complexity of the simplex method with work going back to Klee). In my talk I will discuss some natural counting problems associated with the discrete geometric situation. Our main enumerative results include bounds on the number of monotone paths, and on the the diameter of the space of monotone paths (how far are two monotone paths from each other?). The picture is fairly complete in dimension three, but plenty of open problems remain for high dimensional polytopes. </p> <p>The new theorems presented in my talk come from three recent papers (in Arxiv), the first joint work with Moise Blanchard (MIT) and Quentin Louveaux (U. Liege) the second joint work with Christos Athanasiadis (U. Athens) and Zhenyang Zhang (UC Davis), the third with Sean Kafer (U. Waterloo) and Laura Sanita (Eidhoven U).</p>",

The standard way of proving results about the result is via the bottleneck stability of persistence diagrams. However, it turns out that in many cases this provides a highly pessimistic approximation result. In this talk, I will present recent results which show that the structure of an underlying space appears much earlier than expected and is remarkably stable. I will describe how these results fit into our understanding of the stability of persistence and show how the persistent approach can be useful in new ways. The talk will assume some passing familiarity with persistent homology and TDA but will not assume any previous knowledge about percolation. </p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Reeb graphs and main other related graphical signatures have extensive use in applications, but only recently has there been intense interest in finding metrics for these objects. In this talk, we introduce an extension of smoothing on Reeb graphs, which we call truncated smoothing; this in turn allows us to define a new family of metrics which generalize the interleaving distance for Reeb graphs. Intuitively, we ``chop off'' parts near local minima and maxima during the course of smoothing. After formalizing truncation as a functor, we show that when applied after the smoothing functor, this prevents extensive expansion of the range of the function, and yields particularly nice properties (such as maintaining connectivity) when combined with smoothing. Further, for certain choices of the truncation parameter, we have additional structure which we can take advantage of to construct a categorical flow for any choice of slope <i>m</i> in <i>[0,1]</i>. Using the infrastructure built for a category with a flow, this then gives an interleaving distance for every <i>m</i> in <i>[0,1]</i>, which is a generalization of the original interleaving distance, which is the case <i>m=0</i>. While the resulting metrics are not stable, we show that any pair of these for <i>m,m'</i> in <i>[0,1)</i> are strongly equivalent metrics, which in turn gives stability of each metric up to a multiplicative constant. This talk is on joint work with Erin Chambers and Tim Ophelders. </p>",

This phenomenon, known as quantum vortex reconnection, occurs even though the superfluid does not lose its smoothness. This usually leads to a change of topology of the quantum vortices. In this talk I will show that, given any initial and final congurations of quantum vortices (i.e. closed curves, possibly knotted and linked), and any way of transforming one into the other through a generic pseudo-Seifert surface embedded in spacetime, there is an initial condition whose associatedsolution realizes this specific vortex reconnection scenario. This allows us to track the vortex reconnection process at all times, both locally and globally.

Interestingly, even though they are not ubiquitous, knots in proteins have been conserved within species that are separated by millions of years of evolution.

Besides the role of knotting in proteins, the pathway that the backbone of a knotted protein follows to reach its native folded state is still an open question.
